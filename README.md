### Hi, I'm Panos 👋

---

<!-- I'm Panos, I'm a Full Stack Developer with more than 10 years of professional experience.

My primary focus over the past 10 years has been Javascript & Python development, namely Django, Flask, Node.js, React and React Native. I'm also experienced with frontend development including HTML, CSS and jQuery, Express, MongoDB.

I have done a substantial amount of backend work that has allowed me to become familiar with a number of different technologies and frameworks that aren't necessarily limited to web. I'm comfortable with SQL and have worked with a number of relational databases, primarily Postgres and MySQL.

My collegiate training and first four years of professional career revolved primarily around PHP, Java and Angular.

In addition to development, i hold two Bachelor (Bachelor of Science & Bachelor of Education) and a Master degree all of them in Computer Science..-->
